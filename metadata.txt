about=Displays a geologic stereonet of selected geologic structure data. Data needs to be loaded into QGIS via "Delimited Text Layer." A stereonet will be plotted if there is a column labeled "Strike" or "DDR" and "Dip" (case doesn't matter). Poles of the structures are plotted on an equal area stereonet with a modified Kamb method contouring.
